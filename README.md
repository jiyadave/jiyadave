# About Me 


👩🏽‍💻👩🏽‍🎓🌍

During COVID, whilst being furloughed, I took the opportunity to self-learn Python and completed the Python 2 Codecademy 
course. Since then, I’ve been developing my Excel skills as well as SQL and I’ve gained a vast amount of experience in data analysis via my merchandising roles.

## Currently Working On

I’ve recently been fortunate enough to secure a fully funded scholarship by the Department for Education at Co Grammar, which is for a Skills Software Engineering Bootcamp delivered by Hyperion Dev. This is an intense 4-month bootcamp which specialises in Python. The bootcamp has enabled me to make use of my logical thinking skills and has been a challenging yet rewarding opportunity. I have also gained some knowledge of Docker and I have a snapshot of some of my projects uploaded onto repositories on GitHub.
